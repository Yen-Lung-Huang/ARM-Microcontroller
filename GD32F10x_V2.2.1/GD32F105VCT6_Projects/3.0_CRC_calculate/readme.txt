    \brief   description of CRC example

*/

This example is adapted to GD32F105VCT6 MCU, it shows how to use CRC to 
calculate the CRC value. 

In this demo, 1 CRC value and a value group are calculated for a 32-bit data,  If
the result is success, turn on the LED2 and LED3.

This demo can be further developed to calculate checksum for a group of data, a binary file, etc
